# Bug Fix & UI Polish Pass

## Feature Information
- **Feature ID**: FEAT-039
- **Created**: 2026-03-01
- **Last Updated**: 2026-03-01
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: P0 (Must Have)
- **Owner**: TBD
- **Related RFC**: RFC-039

## User Story

**As** a OneClawShadow user,
**I want** the app to be stable, polished, and free of the issues I reported during testing,
**so that** I can reliably use Google OAuth, manage agents, browse files, search history, send attachments, and manage scheduled tasks without friction.

### Typical Scenarios

1. User tries to sign in with Google OAuth but the flow fails silently or crashes.
2. User switches to a new conversation and expects daily logs to be flushed for future search.
3. User searches past conversations via `search_history` tool but sees the current message in results.
4. User opens the file browser and sees an empty directory instead of their files.
5. User wants to adjust temperature/max iterations on a built-in agent but the controls are missing or disabled.
6. User wants to attach a file to a chat message but there is no attachment button.
7. User clicks a tool call in chat and wants to see its parameters.
8. User expects the tool management screen to auto-refresh when tools are registered/unregistered.
9. User finds it hard to navigate 30+ built-in tools without grouping.
10. User cannot tell that scheduled task rows are clickable.

## Feature Description

### Overview

FEAT-039 is a comprehensive bug fix and UI polish pass addressing 15 issues reported during user testing. Changes span 7 feature areas: Google OAuth, chat, agent detail, tool management, bridge settings, file browser, search history, and scheduled tasks.

## Dependencies

### Depends On
- FEAT-001 (Chat): ChatViewModel, ChatScreen
- FEAT-002 (Agent): AgentDetailScreen, AgentDetailViewModel
- FEAT-004 (Tool System): ToolRegistry
- FEAT-017 (Tool Management): ToolManagementScreen
- FEAT-019 (Scheduled Tasks): ScheduledTaskEditViewModel, ScheduledTaskListScreen

### Depended On By
- None

## Error Handling

### Google OAuth Errors
1. **UnknownHostException**: "Network unavailable. Check your internet connection and try again."
2. **SocketTimeoutException**: "Connection timed out. Check your internet connection and try again."
3. **No auth code received**: "No authorization code received (timed out or cancelled)"
4. **Token exchange failure after 3 retries**: Shows the last error message

### Search History
1. **Current message in results**: 5-second buffer automatically excludes very recent messages

## Test Points

### Unit Tests Modified
- `SearchHistoryUseCaseTest`: Updated `coVerify` assertions from `Long.MAX_VALUE` to `any()` to accommodate the 5-second buffer
- `ScheduledTaskEditViewModelTest`: Updated to expect alarm dialog for editing tasks (was previously asserting no dialog)

### Build Config
- `app/build.gradle.kts`: Added `isReturnDefaultValues = true` in `testOptions.unitTests` to prevent `android.util.Log` from throwing in JVM tests
