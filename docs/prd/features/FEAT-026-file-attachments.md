# File Attachments

## Feature Information
- **Feature ID**: FEAT-026
- **Created**: 2026-03-01
- **Last Updated**: 2026-03-01
- **Status**: Draft
- **Priority**: P1 (Should Have)
- **Owner**: TBD
- **Related RFC**: RFC-026 (pending)

## User Story

**As** a user of OneClawShadow,
**I want** to attach images, videos, and files to my chat messages,
**so that** I can send visual and document context to AI models for analysis, and view attached media inline within the conversation.

### Typical Scenarios

1. The user takes a photo of a document with their camera and sends it to the AI for OCR or summarization.
2. The user selects an image from their gallery and asks the AI to describe or analyze it.
3. The user attaches a video from their gallery and asks the AI to analyze it (Gemini) or receives a notification that video is not supported by the current provider.
4. The user attaches a PDF or text file and asks the AI to summarize its contents.
5. The user taps on an image in a message bubble to view it full-screen with zoom and pan.
6. The user taps on a video thumbnail in a message bubble to play it with the system video player.

## Feature Description

### Overview

FEAT-026 adds multimodal input support to the chat interface. Users can attach images, videos, and files to their messages via an attachment button in the chat input area. Attached media is displayed as previews before sending and rendered inline in message bubbles after sending. Users can tap on media to view images full-screen or play videos with the system player.

This feature also extends the API adapter layer to support multimodal content for all three providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), with graceful handling when a provider does not support a particular media type.

### Detailed Description

#### Attachment Button and Picker

- An attachment button ("+") is added to the chat input action row, to the right of the Skill button
- Tapping the button opens a bottom sheet with four options:
  - **Photo**: Select images from the device gallery (Photo Picker API)
  - **Video**: Select videos from the device gallery (Photo Picker API)
  - **Camera**: Take a photo with the device camera (no video recording)
  - **File**: Select any file from the device (SAF document picker)
- Multiple images/videos can be selected at once from the gallery
- Selected files are copied to app-internal storage at `files/attachments/{sessionId}/`

#### Attachment Preview (Pre-send)

- After selecting files, a horizontally scrollable preview row appears above the text input field
- Each preview item shows:
  - **Image**: Thumbnail with a remove (X) button
  - **Video**: Thumbnail with duration overlay and remove button
  - **File**: File name, size, and remove button
- Users can remove individual attachments before sending

#### Message Bubble Display (Post-send)

- User message bubbles display attached media inline:
  - **Images**: Rendered as rounded thumbnails (max width ~240dp), displayed above the text content
  - **Videos**: Thumbnail with a play button overlay
  - **Files**: Card-style display with file icon, name, and size
- Multiple attachments are displayed in a vertical list within the bubble

#### Media Viewer (Tap Interaction)

- **Image**: Opens a full-screen image viewer with pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures
- **Video**: Opens with the system video player via Intent
- **File**: Opens with the appropriate system app via Intent (ACTION_VIEW)

#### Provider Compatibility

Before sending a message with attachments, the system checks whether the current provider supports each attachment type:

| Attachment Type | OpenAI | Anthropic | Gemini |
|----------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Video | No | No | Yes |
| File (PDF, etc.) | No (text extraction only) | Yes (PDF via base64) | Yes |

If an attachment type is not supported by the current provider, a Snackbar notification warns the user that the unsupported attachment will be skipped. The message is still sent with the text and any supported attachments.

### User Interaction Flows

#### Attaching and Sending an Image

```
1. User taps the "+" button in the chat input area
2. Bottom sheet appears with Photo / Video / Camera / File options
3. User taps "Photo"
4. System Photo Picker opens
5. User selects one or more images
6. Images are copied to internal storage
7. Preview thumbnails appear above the text input
8. User types a message (optional) and taps Send
9. Message is sent with text + image attachments to the AI provider
10. Message bubble shows the image(s) inline above the text
11. AI response arrives (may reference the image content)
```

#### Viewing an Attached Image

```
1. User taps on an image in a message bubble
2. Full-screen image viewer opens
3. User can pinch to zoom and pan
4. User taps back or swipes down to dismiss
```

#### Unsupported Attachment Warning

```
1. User has OpenAI provider selected
2. User attaches a video
3. User taps Send
4. Snackbar appears: "Video attachments are not supported by this provider and will be skipped"
5. Message is sent with text only (video is excluded)
6. The video attachment is still stored locally and shown in the message bubble
```

## Business Rules

### Functional Rules

1. Attachments are always copied to app-internal storage; the app never references external URIs after initial copy
2. Each attachment gets a UUID filename to avoid collisions: `{uuid}.{extension}`
3. Thumbnails for images and videos are generated at copy time and stored alongside the original
4. A message can have 0 or more attachments; there is no hard limit on count in V1
5. When a provider does not support an attachment type, the attachment is skipped with a Snackbar warning, and the message is still sent with supported attachments and text
6. If all attachments are unsupported but text is present, the message is sent as text-only
7. If all attachments are unsupported and no text is present, sending is blocked with an error message
8. Attachment files are stored per-session: `files/attachments/{sessionId}/`
9. Deleting a session cascades to delete the `files/attachments/{sessionId}/` directory

### Data Rules

- Maximum individual file size: 20MB (enforced at selection time)
- Supported image MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`
- Supported video MIME types: `video/mp4`, `video/webm`, `video/quicktime`
- File type: any MIME type (generic file handling)
- Thumbnails: JPEG format, max 256x256 pixels

### Permission Rules

- Camera: Requires `android.permission.CAMERA` (requested at runtime)
- Photo/Video picker: No permission required (Photo Picker API on Android 13+, READ_MEDIA_IMAGES/READ_MEDIA_VIDEO on older)
- File picker: No permission required (SAF handles access)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- File copy to internal storage: < 2 seconds for files up to 20MB
- Thumbnail generation: < 500ms per image/video
- Base64 encoding: < 1 second for files up to 20MB
- Attachment preview rendering: < 100ms (use pre-generated thumbnails)
- Message bubble with attachments: Smooth scrolling at 60fps (use Coil for lazy image loading)

### Memory

- Thumbnails: ~256KB per image at 256x256 JPEG
- Base64 encoded file in memory: ~1.3x original file size (temporary, during API call)
- Image viewer: Single full-resolution image loaded at a time

### Compatibility

- Photo Picker: Android 13+ (native), 11-12 (backport via ActivityResultContracts)
- Camera capture: All supported Android versions
- SAF document picker: All supported Android versions

## Dependencies

### Depends On

- **FEAT-001 (Chat)**: Chat screen, message model, message repository
- **FEAT-016 (Chat Input Redesign)**: Current ChatInput layout that will be extended

### Depended On By

- None currently

### External Dependencies

- **Coil**: Image loading library (likely already in project, or add dependency)
- **Android Photo Picker API**: System component
- **Android Camera Intent**: System component
- **Android SAF (Storage Access Framework)**: System component

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios

1. **File too large**
   - Cause: Selected file exceeds 20MB limit
   - Handling: Show Snackbar "File is too large (max 20MB)" and do not add to attachments

2. **File copy failure**
   - Cause: Insufficient storage space or I/O error
   - Handling: Show Snackbar "Failed to save attachment" and do not add to attachments

3. **Camera not available**
   - Cause: Device has no camera or camera permission denied
   - Handling: Show Snackbar "Camera not available" or launch permission request

4. **Thumbnail generation failure**
   - Cause: Corrupt image/video file
   - Handling: Use a generic placeholder icon; file is still attachable

5. **Base64 encoding failure**
   - Cause: File deleted between selection and send
   - Handling: Skip the attachment, warn user, send remaining content

6. **Provider API rejection**
   - Cause: File too large for provider limits, unsupported format
   - Handling: Report error in AI response (provider error message)
