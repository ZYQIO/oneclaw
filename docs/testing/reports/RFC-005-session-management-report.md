# Test Report: RFC-005 — Session Management

## Report Information

| Status | PASS |

## Summary

RFC-005 implements session management: creating, listing, renaming, soft-deleting (with undo), and batch-deleting sessions. The session drawer UI is a stateful composable backed by `SessionListViewModel`. Title generation (truncated + AI-powered) is also included.

| Layer | Step | Result | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1A | JVM Unit Tests | PASS | 246 tests (239 Debug + 5 Roborazzi Debug), 0 failures |
| 1B | Instrumented DAO Tests | PASS | 47 tests, 0 failures |
| 1C | Roborazzi Screenshot Tests | PASS | 6 new screenshots recorded and verified |
| 2 | adb Visual Flows | SKIP | Session drawer not yet wired to MainActivity nav graph; chat not implemented |

## Layer 1A: JVM Unit Tests

**Command:** `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`

**Result:** PASS

**Test count:** 246 tests, 0 failures

New test classes added in this RFC:

| Class | Tests |
|-------|-------|
| `CreateSessionUseCaseTest` | 4 |
| `DeleteSessionUseCaseTest` | 3 |
| `BatchDeleteSessionsUseCaseTest` | 4 |
| `RenameSessionUseCaseTest` | 7 |
| `GenerateTitleUseCaseTest` | 11 |
| `SessionListViewModelTest` | 24 |
| **New total** | **53** |

Note: The Release variant Roborazzi tests fail with `Unable to resolve activity` — this is a pre-existing Robolectric/Release manifest configuration issue unrelated to RFC-005 changes.

## Layer 1B: Instrumented Tests

**Command:** `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`

**Result:** PASS

**Device:** Medium_Phone_API_36.1 (AVD) — API 36

**Test count:** 47 DAO tests, 0 failures

No new instrumented tests were added for RFC-005 (session feature has no new DAOs; `SessionDao` was implemented in Phase 1 and already covered).

## Layer 1C: Roborazzi Screenshot Tests

**Commands:**
```bash
./gradlew recordRoborazziDebug
./gradlew verifyRoborazziDebug
```

**Result:** PASS

New test class: `SessionDrawerScreenshotTest` — 6 screenshots

Note: `RenameSessionDialog` (uses `AlertDialog`) was excluded from screenshot tests due to a known Robolectric + Material 3 animation incompatibility (`AppNotIdleException`). The dialog is covered by ViewModel unit tests.

### SessionDrawer — populated

![SessionDrawer_populated](../../app/src/test/screenshots/SessionDrawer_populated.png)

Shows "New conversation" button at top, three session list items with title, message preview, relative timestamp, and agent name chip. Layout and typography correct.

### SessionDrawer — selectionMode

![SessionDrawer_selectionMode](../../app/src/test/screenshots/SessionDrawer_selectionMode.png)

Top toolbar shows X (cancel), "1 selected" text, "All" button, and trash icon. Session items show checkboxes on the left with the first item checked. Correct.

### SessionDrawer — empty

![SessionDrawer_empty](../../app/src/test/screenshots/SessionDrawer_empty.png)

Shows "New conversation" button and "No conversations yet." centered message.

### SessionDrawer — loading

![SessionDrawer_loading](../../app/src/test/screenshots/SessionDrawer_loading.png)

Shows "New conversation" button and centered `CircularProgressIndicator`.

### SessionDrawer — undoState

![SessionDrawer_undoState](../../app/src/test/screenshots/SessionDrawer_undoState.png)

Shows two remaining sessions after one was deleted (undo state is in ViewModel, not rendered as a visible snackbar in the drawer itself — snackbar integration is deferred to chat scaffold in RFC-001).

### SessionDrawer — dark theme

![SessionDrawer_dark](../../app/src/test/screenshots/SessionDrawer_dark.png)

Dark background with correct Material 3 dark color scheme applied throughout.

## Layer 2: adb Visual Verification

**Result:** SKIP

**Reason:** The session drawer is not yet wired into `MainActivity`'s navigation graph. The `SessionDrawerContent` composable exists and is ready for integration, but the nav graph entry point and chat screen (RFC-001) are not yet implemented. Will be executed as part of the full Layer 2 pass after all RFCs are complete.
