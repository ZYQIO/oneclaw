# Manual Test Guide — OneClawShadow

This document is the cumulative, always-up-to-date guide for manually testing the OneClawShadow app. It describes every user-facing flow that exists in the current implementation, and how to verify it on a real device or emulator.

**How to use this guide:**
- Before any release, execute all flows in this guide from a fresh install.
- Update this guide whenever an RFC adds, changes, or removes user-facing behavior.
- This guide reflects the current state of the app, not planned future features.

## Document Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Last updated | 2026-02-27 |
| App version | 0.1.0 |
| Last RFC implemented | RFC-001 (Chat Interaction) + RFC-002 (Agent Management) |
| Status | Full app implemented: Setup, Provider management, Tool system, Session management, Agent management, and Chat with streaming |

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Android device or emulator (API 26+)
- App installed: `./gradlew installDebug` or `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- For provider connection tests: API key for at least one provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini)

### Fresh Install

```bash
adb shell pm clear com.oneclaw.shadow
adb shell am start -n com.oneclaw.shadow/.MainActivity
```

---

## Current App State

As of the last implemented RFC (RFC-001 + RFC-002), the app supports:
- First-launch setup flow (choose provider, enter API key, select default model)
- Provider management (list, detail, API key, connection test, model list)
- Settings screen with "Manage Agents" entry point
- Tool system (backend + per-agent tool configuration in AgentDetailScreen)
- Session management (drawer UI with new/switch/delete/rename sessions)
- Agent management (list, create, edit, clone, delete custom agents; view built-in agents)
- Chat with streaming: SSE streaming from OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini, tool call loop, thinking blocks, message history

**All planned RFCs have been implemented.**
